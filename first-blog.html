    <h2 class="blog-heading">
      A civil/construction engineer learns to code A shattered dream and humble
      beginning
    </h2>
    <p class="blog-heading">
      26th October 2019, I received a push notification for an email from the
      University of Reading. The email said that my application for studying
      Master’s in Construction Management had been accepted conditionally. I was
      thrilled. In the next three-four months, I would meet a Study Abroad
      consultant, figure out my options, apply in twelve different universities
      and colleges in the U.K and Canada.
      <br />
      <br />
      I worked on writing better Statement of Purpose for all those
      universities, got a Letter of Recommendation from my colleagues at work,
      appeared in IELTS exam and scored more than required bands. Post this,
      seven universities sent me unconditional offer letters to study Masters in
      Construction Management. By mid-March, I was figuring out how to arrange
      the funds for the study, It was difficult, but I figured eventually
      something or other will work out & I was excited to fly to the U.K. &
      start my studies in September-2020.
      <br />
      <br />
      Fast Forward to 1st July 2020, 10 Million people had been tested positive
      for Coronavirus till then, out of which almost 300K people were from the
      U.K. alone and 600K were from my home country, India. Many universities
      decided their entire session next year would go online while most of them
      decided for Blended Education. The construction industry in the U.K got
      affected badly because of the interrupted supply of material, migration of
      labour & lockdown imposed by the Government. A lot of employees working in
      the construction industry lost their jobs. In short, my dreams were
      crushed.
      <br />
      <br />
      I had put so much effort into this study abroad thing for almost five
      months & because of it, I got emotionally attached to it. I had put all my
      hopes in it & I could see the results too but suddenly because of
      Coronavirus I lost everything.
    </p>
    <h2 class="blog-heading">freeCodeCamp comes to rescue</h2>
    <p class="blog-heading">
      Then suddenly I saw one of my good friends, Jai’s number flashing on my
      mobile screen who also happens to be a very successful programmer. I had
      been trying to talk to him for some time. I told him everything. He
      suggested various things & then he mentioned
      <a href="https:freeCodeCamp.com">freeCodeCamp</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 class="blog-heading">My first line of code</h2>
    <p class="blog-heading">
      I wanted to code for a long time, but then I used to tell myself, "You're
      a Civil Engineer working for almost eight years in the Construction
      Industry. How can you code, you haven’t studied Computer Science". But I
      wanted to give it a shot. I opened the website, made an account & started
      my first lesson for HTML. The website had three sections, the first
      vertical section would have the information about the topic & a coding
      challenge, the second vertical section would the section where you type
      the code & the third one would show you what that code did for you & I
      wrote my first line of code: Hello World As soon as I wrote it, the
      preview panel flashed: Hello World, this was such a beautiful feeling when
      you could see the result of your code in a matter of a few seconds. Just
      like that, I completed my first coding challenge. The first thing I did
      was to take the screenshot & send it to Jai. He was happy for me and he
      agreed to guide me through the process. He asked me to promise him that I
      would give one hour to coding for 30 days with
      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/">NOZERODAY</a> . I promised
      instantly, and my beautiful journey of coding started.
    </p>
    <h2 class="blog-heading">Community help</h2>
    <p class="blog-heading">
      Unlike the first coding challenge, I found the following coding challenges
      comparatively difficult but thankfully, in freeCodeCamp, there's a help
      section where you can take help by either getting a hint or Watching a
      video and if none of this helps you, You can Ask for Help from the Coding
      Community. So for the next few challenges I had to Watch a Video to
      understand how I was supposed to do that particular challenge.
      <br />
      <br />
      Slowly and steadily, I was making progress. In the next few challenges, I
      didn't have to watch a video, and getting a hint would be enough for me to
      complete the coding challenge. Finally, I was at a point where I was
      completing the coding challenges without any help whatsoever.
      <br />
      <br />
      But one day, I got stuck at a challenge, I couldn't figure out what was
      wrong with my code, I got a hint which didn't work, I tried watching a
      video that didn't help me either. I didn't know what to do next, I
      immediately texted Jai, I waited for his reply, but I was losing patience.
      Then it struck me that there was one more option of getting help, Asking
      for Help.
      <br />
      <br />
      So I posted my query on
      <a href="https://forum.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp forum</a>. To my
      surprise, I started getting replies on my query within 2 minutes. I
      couldn't believe it. I guess community support is one of the biggest
      reasons a lot of self-learners are achieving great results.
      <br />
      <br />
      I also wanted to be a part of this amazing community, so I made an account
      on <a href="https://discord.com/">discord</a> and joined freeCodeCamp
      server and started chatting. The first day on discord was amazing; people
      there were quite welcoming and encouraging. Before starting on discord, I
      had already begun to post my journey on Twitter and started looking for
      people going through the same journey, but I couldn't find anyone who had
      a similar situation like mine.
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <h2 class="blog-heading">
      A mentor can help you in so many ways & if he/she is a friend then you
      can't ask for more
    </h2>
    <p class="blog-heading">
      Throughout all this Jai was there for my support, as promised, I would
      update him daily about my committed one hour of coding, he guided me about
      discord, Twitter, etc. He has been a great support. There were some days
      when my office work would extend till late in the night, and I was so
      tired to code but I felt accountable towards my commitment to Jai, and I
      would push myself and complete my one hour of coding.
      <br />
      <br />
      After two weeks of coding, Jai suggested that I go for
      <a href="https://www.learninpublic.org/">The Coding Career Handbook.</a>
      This gave me a perspective to look at the implications of my work. By this
      time, I had completed all the coding challenges of Responsive Web Design
      and now it was the time for the projects When I saw the project exercises
      for the first time, I got intimidated. I realised that though I had done
      almost everything that the user stories said but to complete the projects
      I'd have to go through the coding challenges all over again.
    </p>
    <h2 class="blog-heading">The burnout</h2>
    <p class="blog-heading">
      So then, the craziest period of my coding journey started. There was a lot
      of office work, after finishing the office work l would go through the
      coding challenges again to understand how to go about the coding projects
      & then I'll work for an hour on my coding projects. I'd spend some time on
      the coding career book, Twitter, and discord, and at last, I would read a
      couple of more books. I slept very little for almost a week.
      <br />
      <br />
      Connecting with the community on twitter & discord has been the most
      difficult thing for me. But I was making some progress, and I am still
      working on it. At the end of that crazy week, I was on the verge of a
      burnout, but somehow Jai got to know about it, probably because I was
      sending him my progress screenshots at 2:00, 3:00 & sometimes at 4:00 AM.
      He asked me if I was putting too much stress on, I conveniently lied to
      him, but I learned my lesson from that week onwards I started to sleep
      earlier than the previous night & so on.
    </p>
    <h2 class="blog-heading">Earning my first certificate</h2>
    <p class="blog-heading">
      The day I finished my first coding project, my happiness knew no bounds,
      because the first time I saw the project exercise I told myself that I
      would not be able to do that, coding challenges were different but project
      exercises were a different ball game altogether, but I had faith in the
      faith that Jai had in me & I kept going until I finished my first coding
      project & later on four more of them.
      <br />
      <br />
      On the 27th day of my journey, I completed all of my five projects & got
      my first
      <a
        href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/nareshpoonia/responsive-web-design"
        >certificate</a
      >
      , Responsive Web Design Developer Certificate from freeCodeCamp. I still
      don’t know if this is a big deal, but that surely made me extremely happy
      and proud.
