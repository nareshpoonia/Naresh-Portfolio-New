    <h1 class="blog-heading">My first week of learning JavaScript</h1>
    <p class="blog-heading">
      Hello World! I am a 30-Year-Old civil/construction engineer, learning to
      code for the first time. I share my journey and learning here.
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <h2 class="blog-heading">The Journey is Underrated</h2>
    <p class="blog-heading">
      I was delighted after getting my first certification from freeCodeCamp,
      but I knew that this happiness like all the happiness in life, this too
      will fade away in a day or two if not earlier, So on that very day I get
      my certification, I took up Javascript.
    </p>
    <h2 class="blog-heading">Why you ought to write more</h2>
    <p class="blog-heading">
      Around the same time my friend and mentor, Jai, introduced me to Dev.to,
      He encouraged me to write my story here. At first, I was a bit
      apprehensive about writing a post here, I thought who would want to read a
      story of a code newbie here but I went for it anyway and opened up my
      heart in my post and posted a week ago. I didn’t expect that my post would
      get such a good reception. I would also urge you all to write about your
      journey, It will help a lot of people who are just starting or who are
      just a month or two behind you in learning. If you are making any mistake
      the more experienced devs can correct you and guide you & on the top of
      it, writing has tons of benefits. And yes to be able to communicate
      clearly is a very important skill for a coder.
    </p>
    <h2 class="blog-heading">People are noticing your work</h2>
    <p class="blog-heading">
      I was posting my journey on twitter since my first day of coding, One of
      my friends, Shreyans who is a Full Stack Javascript Developer, would like
      my tweet once in a while, apparently, he has been following my tweets and
      one day commented on one of my tweets, I was delighted to read his
      comment, Nothing matches a genuine appreciation from a friend.

    </p>
    <h2 class="blog-heading">Trolls are going to find you</h2>
    <p class="blog-heading">
      The following morning when I woke up, there was this notification about a
      comment on Twitter. That was my first encounter with a troll on twitter.
      As you move ahead in your journey you’ll begin seeing an ever-increasing
      number of comments from people saying inflammatory and offensive things
      but you shouldn’t let your journey effect from this because Trolls often
      don’t believe a word they write but say it anyway just to piss off anyone

    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-heading">Learning in Public</h2>
    <p class="blog-heading">
      After finishing my first certification, I also publicly committed myself
      to make a personal portfolio website in a month’s time because in all my
      Responsive Web Design Projects I didn’t put much effort into the
      presentation of the webpages and I focussed principally on understanding
      the user stories and applying my learning to pass the tests. So I knew
      that I could do better & make a more presentable website and a Personal
      portfolio would serve both the purposes of applying your learning as well
      as showcasing your projects to the world.

    </p>
    <h2 class="blog-heading">An effective way to share your code</h2>
    <p class="blog-heading">
      I found Javascript more difficult than HTML & CSS but my understanding of
      the language improved as I spent more time on it. I also started to share
      my code in my tweets using
      <a href="https://carbon.now.sh">carbon</a>, I found this really effective
      because you can sum up your learning of the day in one or more codes,
      which help you revise your learning at the end of your coding.

    <h2 class="blog-heading">Why you ought to tune in to podcasts</h2>
    <p class="blog-heading">
      I had also started listening to tech podcasts but finding the one which
      was easier for a newbie to understand was a task but as they say “Those
      who seek shall find”.
      <br />
      <br />
      I found some excellent podcasts, out of them I really liked this one. In
      this
      <a
        href="https://freecodecamp.libsyn.com/ep-25-im-56-and-learning-to-code-heres-an-epic-beat-down-of-my-critical-inner-self"
        >podcast</a
      >
      , Abbey Rennemeyer reads out an article about a 56-year-old guy explaining
      why learning to code would be the best decision for him even at this age
      and he does give good reasoning. Like posts here on DEV, podcasts would
      also make you feel that you are not alone in the journey and how other
      people have achieved great things. You can learn from their journey, get
      inspired & achieve your goals too.
